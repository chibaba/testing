// Odd or Even) Write an application that reads an integer and determines and prints wheth-
// er itâ€™s odd or even. [Hint: Use the remainder operator. An even number is a multiple of 2. Any mul-
// tiple of 2 leaves a remainder of 0 when divided by 2

//pseudo
// collect number from user
//save number from user
// if number is divisible by 2 without a remainder, number is an even number
//if number is duvisible by 1 and itself equals odd number
