// You roll two dice. Each die has six faces, which contain one, two, three, four, five and
// six spots, respectively. After the dice have come to rest, the sum of the spots on the two
// upward faces is calculated. If the sum is 7 or 11 on the first throw, you win. If the sum
// is 2, 3 or 12 on the first throw (called “craps”), you lose (i.e., the “house” wins). If the
// sum is 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 or 10 on the first throw, that sum becomes your “point.” To win,
// you must continue rolling the dice until you “make your point” (i.e., roll that same
// point value). You lose by rolling a 7 before making your point.
